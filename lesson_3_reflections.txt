When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To work on other devices, or share with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling automatically it may have incomplete features that need several
     commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used when I want to clone a repository on GitHub to my GitHub.
    Clone is used when I clone a repository from and to local or from GitHub to
     local.
    Branch is used when I make a new branch in a local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allowing to work on offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Use email or other VCS.
    After adjusting to Git and GitHub, it will be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When suggesting new features, ideas, and so on.
    Using a separate branch makes the master branch or other main branches
     clean.
    Using the master branch directly is simple, straightforward.
